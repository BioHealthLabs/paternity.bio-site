        A paternity DNA test compares the child’s DNA with a potential father’s DNA to see whether
        there is a biological relationship. Kits differ mainly in how the samples are collected,
        whether the results are legally documented, and how the results may be used.

          Laws about DNA testing and consent differ between countries and even regions. In many
          places, collecting or testing someone’s DNA without proper consent can be illegal.
          Always make sure you understand the rules where you live, and aim for transparent

          If there is any chance your situation could become legal, speak with a lawyer or

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="card faq" aria-labelledby="faq-heading">
      <h2 id="faq-heading" class="section-title">Paternity DNA FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Are at-home paternity kits reliable?</h3>
      <p>
        Modern paternity tests from accredited labs can be highly accurate when samples are
        collected and processed correctly. However, accuracy also depends on lab quality and
        following instructions. For legal cases, courts usually require tests to be performed
        under strict chain-of-custody procedures, not just mailed from home.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use a peace-of-mind test in court later?</h3>
      <p>
        In many jurisdictions, peace-of-mind kits are <strong>not</strong> accepted as legal
        evidence because the lab cannot verify who provided the samples. If there is a realistic
        chance of a legal dispute, talk to a lawyer or an accredited local lab about a
        court-admissible option rather than relying on a home kit.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does a paternity test take?</h3>
      <p>
        Labs often report results within a few working days after they receive the samples,
        although shipping can add time. Faster processing is sometimes available for an
        additional fee. Always check the provider’s current estimates before ordering.
      </p>

      <h3>Will the test reveal other sensitive information?</h3>
      <p>
        Most dedicated paternity labs report only whether the tested man is the biological
        father. Wider ancestry or health providers may show additional relatives, ethnic
        breakdowns or traits. If you want to limit what you learn, choose a focused paternity
        product rather than a broad ancestry kit.
